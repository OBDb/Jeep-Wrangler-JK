    description: "The Jeep Wrangler JK represented the third generation of the Wrangler lineup and the most substantial redesign in the model's history to that point. Most significantly, it introduced the four-door Unlimited variant with a 20.6-inch longer wheelbase, dramatically expanding the Wrangler's practicality and appeal to a broader audience. Built on a completely new platform with a wider track for improved stability, it maintained traditional body-on-frame construction and solid axles front and rear. Initially powered by a 3.8L V6 producing 202 HP and 237 lb-ft of torque, paired with either a six-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. In 2012, this was replaced by the more powerful and efficient 3.6L Pentastar V6 delivering 285 HP and 260 lb-ft of torque, coupled with a five-speed automatic or six-speed manual. The interior was significantly more refined than previous generations, with improved materials, better ergonomics, and available features including power windows and locks (a first for Wrangler), navigation, and premium audio systems. Off-road capability remained paramount with available Command-Trac and Rock-Trac four-wheel drive systems, electronic locking differentials, electronic sway bar disconnect on Rubicon models, and improved approach and departure angles. The modular top design provided multiple configurations, from fully enclosed to completely open, maintaining the Wrangler's signature open-air experience. Throughout its production run, numerous special editions were offered including the Call of Duty, Arctic, Moab, Altitude, and Willys Wheeler. The JK's production overlapped with the introduction of the next-generation JL for several months in 2018, with later JKs designated as Wrangler JK models to differentiate them. The third-generation Wrangler, particularly the four-door Unlimited variant, transformed the model from a niche off-road vehicle to a mainstream lifestyle vehicle, more than tripling annual sales compared to the previous generation while maintaining the authentic character that defines the Wrangler lineup."
